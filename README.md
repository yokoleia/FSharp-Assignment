Assignment learning functional programming. QUT Unit CAB402

This assignment uses RandomMonad: A custom monadic function written by the university to allow the use of an RNG function as a monad to remain functionally pure while retaining the ability to run tests.  

My work is under GeneticAlgorithm and TSPModel.
